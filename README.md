## Steps

### Pre-Requirements

**Installation**: GNU/Linux and apt package manager

**Compilation**: GNU/Linux and gcc-14 C23 or higher

* Recommended distro: Ubuntu 24.04 or higher

**Execution**: GNU/Linux and minimum 2GB memory (for 2K60FPS)

### Setup

```./setup.sh```

### Format

```./format.sh```

### Build

```./build.sh```

### Run

```./bridges.sh```

Creates solutions (videos and force data on each member 
and reactions on each support in the tmp directory) 
for each of the six truss bridges: warren, pratt, howe, 
parker, cambridge and whipple without further 
input.

**or**

```./custom.sh```

Creates solution (videos and force data on each member 
and reactions on each support) for a given problem 
containing input data for joints, members, supports, 
loads as well as other input data provided into standard 
input of the shell script (gravity, duration, frame rate, 
step rate, etc...).

Shell script example input:

```
warren.txt
9.8
3.0
10000.0
60.0
1920
1080
0.5
0.125
1.0
1.0
tmp/warren
```

**or**

```./montage.sh```

## Usage

**(low-level)**
